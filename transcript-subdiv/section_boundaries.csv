If, say, tight fiscal policy is the problem, if that’s the reason the economy is growing slowly, it doesn’t mean that monetary policy can’t mitigate that.

Like many of you, I was struck by the difference between consumer and business attitudes. I opened up The New York Times Business section this morning, and the headline was “Firms Don’t Share Consumer Optimism.” I’m wondering why that is. One reason might be that businesses have greater exposure to the global economy.",,
