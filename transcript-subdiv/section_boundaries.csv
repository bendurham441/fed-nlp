That packet contains the policy alternatives as well as the associated draft directives. The one-word change in the language that we distributed Monday is incorporated here.","Yes. This is a vote on alternative B from the handout and the associated directive, with paragraph 2 adjusted as follows. The second sentence now reads, “The Committee expects economic growth over coming quarters to be modest and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.” The bracketed sentence is dropped from the end of that paragraph, and the statement includes paragraph 3′, not 3.",,

Let’s start our economic go-round with President Lacker.","Let me make one comment on that, which is, you sometimes hear the following kind of statement: “Tight monetary policy is not causing the problem; therefore, easing monetary policy won’t help.” That’s a non sequitur. If, say, tight fiscal policy is the problem, if that’s the reason the economy is growing slowly, it doesn’t mean that monetary policy can’t mitigate that. So I think that kind of argument needs to be looked at very carefully. We are doing a lot. We are absolutely doing a lot. There’s no question about it.",,

And with that I will start with a recognized expert in the field of crisp and concise interjections, President Rosengren.","I thought I’d start today with a few comments on the economic go-round. Like many of you, I was struck by the difference between consumer and business attitudes. I opened up The New York Times Business section this morning, and the headline was “Firms Don’t Share Consumer Optimism.” I’m wondering why that is. One reason might be that businesses have greater exposure to the global economy.",,

I will be referring to the handout that was distributed during the coffee break, labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.” As I did at the October meeting, I’d like to start off by taking a longer-term perspective, before turning to the specifics of the current meeting’s policy statement.","Okay. Let me just make sure I’ve got this. The only changes are in paragraph 3—we are putting “maintain” instead of “put” in paragraph 5, not 5′; we are eliminating the things between brackets except maintaining “the asset purchase program ends,” no comma, “and;” and then, for the final bracketed part of that paragraph, we are choosing the",,

Those equations say—and I will come back to the interpretation—basically that an increase in exogenous conditions that are favorable to employment means we can do less. So dx/dg is negative; dx/de—that is, changes in the perceived efficacy—turns out to have ambiguous effects on how much we do, because there is sort of a substitution in income effects, and I will come back to that as well.",,

Thank you, everyone. As a reward for your patience, I will forgo my own remarks. I will say only three things. The first is, a lot of people made reference to revisiting the exit strategy.

I’ll try to give a short summary. I will say that I think there was a little more dissonance today than usual. I’ve been listening very, very carefully, and in terms of the outlook there’s a little bit of a bimodal view. So some of my sentences will have multiple conjunctions in them.",,
