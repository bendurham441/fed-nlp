418,20120125,FOMC2,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ll be referring to the packet of material that was distributed. It should be in front of you. That packet contains the policy alternatives as well as the associated draft directives. The one-word change in the language that we distributed Monday is incorporated here.","Yes. This is a vote on alternative B from the handout and the associated directive, with paragraph 2 adjusted as follows. The second sentence now reads, “The Committee expects economic growth over coming quarters to be modest and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.” The bracketed sentence is dropped from the end of that paragraph, and the statement includes paragraph 3′, not 3."
419,20120125,FOMC1,"Why don’t we reconvene? Let’s begin now with the economic go-round, and I have President Rosengren.","All right. Thank you. That’s fine. Let me make a few comments of my own. Like most others, I see modest, near-trend economic growth over the next year, which of course implies very slow progress in the labor market. I must say—and we’ll discuss this more tomorrow—that it concerns me that we’re missing both parts of our mandate"
420,20120313,FOMC2,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ll be referring to the handout labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives,” which was distributed earlier. The handout contains the policy alternatives and associated directives that were published in the Tealbook last week.","Okay. With that sentence inserted in alternative B, instead of what’s there now, as well as the directive, let me call the roll."
421,20120313,FOMC1,Are we ready to start our go-round? Why don’t we start with the Vice Chairman?,"That’s a good point. Implicit in my statement, which was an ad hoc statement, was the notion that if in fact economic growth stays at 2 percent, we will not see much improvement in unemployment going forward other than that attributable to the end of extraordinary unemployment insurance benefits. If that turns out to be empirically"
422,20120425,FOMC2,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be referring to the handout labeled, “Material for the FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives,” which contains the policy alternatives and associated directives that were published in the Tealbook last week.","This vote is for the statement alternative B, and the associated directive in the handout with the amendments just mentioned by the Chairman."
423,20120425,FOMC1,"Okay. Welcome back, everybody. We’re going to now do the economic go-round. I would very much like to get this done today so that we will be able to have sufficient time to discuss the policy issues tomorrow. So please keep time in mind if at all possible. I’ll start with President Rosengren, who is a model of terse excellence.","Good morning, everybody. Let me start off this morning with a summary of the discussion from yesterday, and then I will add a few comments. There was general agreement that moderate economic growth was continuing. Some participants were more optimistic, noting signs of strength and expressing increased confidence"
424,20120620,FOMC2,I’ll be referring to the handout labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”,"Okay. This vote is on alternative B—the statement as written, no paragraph 5—and the associated directive."
425,20120620,FOMC1,"Welcome back. We’re ready for our economic go-round, and we’ll start with President Lacker.","Good morning, everybody. For my contribution to the go-round, I’d like to talk a little bit, at a 30,000-foot level, about the economy and about our policy tools. To be quite honest, I think the situation is a pretty agonizing one. On the economy, I think that I would associate myself with what’s becoming the Tarullo stuck-in-the-mud hypothesis—"
426,20120801,FOMC2,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ll be referring to the handout labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives,” which includes the small changes to the statement language that we distributed yesterday",Okay. This vote is on alternative B as the Chairman described and on the associated directive.
427,20120801,FOMC1,"Not unless the Committee actually chose one of those alternative policies. Any other questions? [No response] Again, tomorrow we will have a fuller discussion of this and how we will proceed. We’re ready for our economic go-round, and I’ll start with Governor Tarullo.","Thank you. Any other questions? [No response] Okay. Well, I guess that sets us up for the policy discussion, and I’ll turn it over to Bill English."
428,20120913,FOMC1,"I’ve said in press conferences that it’s a symmetric objective and we have a balanced approach, and so on. Anyone else? [No response] All right. Now we come to the main event. Let’s start our economic go-round with President Lacker.","Let me make one comment on that, which is, you sometimes hear the following kind of statement: “Tight monetary policy is not causing the problem; therefore, easing monetary policy won’t help.” That’s a non sequitur. If, say, tight fiscal policy is the problem, if that’s the reason the economy is growing slowly, it doesn’t mean that monetary policy can’t mitigate that. So I think that kind of argument needs to be looked at very carefully. We are doing a lot. We are absolutely doing a lot. There’s no question about it."
429,20120913,FOMC2,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I think the policy alternatives are being handed around right now. They are the same as the ones we distributed earlier this week. I guess I’ll wait just a moment until everybody has them.","In my Jackson Hole remarks, I talked about the guidance. I said it was conditional, dependent on the state of the economy. But in explaining the time, I said we look at rules and optimal control and those sorts of things, but we also take into account some other factors such as downside risks, the effects of the zero lower bound, and implicitly I said the"
430,20121024,FOMC2,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be referring to the package labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.” I’d like to start by looking forward to future policy decisions, before coming back to focus on the specifics of today’s policy decision.",Okay. So let’s go ahead and vote on alternative B as written. Thank you.
431,20121024,FOMC1,"Okay. If everyone is willing, maybe we could get to our economic go-round. It would be terrific if we could do that all today. I ask everyone, to the extent you can, to keep your interjections crisp and concise. And with that I will start with a recognized expert in the field of crisp and concise interjections, President Rosengren.","I thought I’d start today with a few comments on the economic go-round. Like many of you, I was struck by the difference between consumer and business attitudes. I opened up The New York Times Business section this morning, and the headline was “Firms Don’t Share Consumer Optimism.” I’m wondering why that is. One reason might be that businesses have greater exposure to the global economy."
432,20121212,FOMC2,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be referring to the handout that was distributed during the coffee break, labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.” As I did at the October meeting, I’d like to start off by taking a longer-term perspective, before turning to the specifics of the current meeting’s policy statement.","Okay. Let me just make sure I’ve got this. The only changes are in paragraph 3—we are putting “maintain” instead of “put” in paragraph 5, not 5′; we are eliminating the things between brackets except maintaining “the asset purchase program ends,” no comma, “and;” and then, for the final bracketed part of that paragraph, we are choosing the"
433,20121212,FOMC1,"Thank you. Anyone else on financial stability? [No response] If not, we’re ready for our economic go-round, and I have President Williams, fresh back from India.","Up to a sign error, yes. Those equations say—and I will come back to the interpretation—basically that an increase in exogenous conditions that are favorable to employment means we can do less. So dx/dg is negative; dx/de—that is, changes in the perceived efficacy—turns out to have ambiguous effects on how much we do, because there is sort of a substitution in income effects, and I will come back to that as well."
434,20130130,FOMC1,"Okay, why don’t we recommence. We are ready now for our economic go-round, and I’ll start with President Williams.",Thank you for the clarification. Let me make just a few comments. I don’t have a great deal to add. I agree with the general tone of a somewhat better feeling in the economy. The financial markets are reflecting that. I note the increase of about 30
435,20130130,FOMC2,Thank you. Any questions? [No response] All right. We’re now at the point for our policy discussion. We start with Bill English.,"Okay. “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that growth in economic activity paused in recent months, in large part because of weather-related disruptions and other transitory factors.”"
436,20130320,FOMC1,"Thank you. Any other comments in this go-round? [No response] Well, would we like to begin the economic go-round, or do people want to have lunch first?","Thank you very much. Thank you, everyone. As a reward for your patience, I will forgo my own remarks. I will say only three things. The first is, a lot of people made reference to revisiting the exit strategy. It’s relevant not only because of the size of the balance sheet, but also because it interacts with many of the issues we discussed today. In"
437,20130320,FOMC2,Good morning. The last item on our agenda is the monetary policy discussion. Why don’t we start with Bill English.,Yes. This vote is on the version of the statement that the Chairman just described and the associated directive.
438,20130501,FOMC1,"Seeing no other questions, let’s begin our economic go-round, and I’ll turn to President Lockhart.","Thank you very much. Thank you for a very interesting discussion. I’ll try to give a short summary. I will say that I think there was a little more dissonance today than usual. I’ve been listening very, very carefully, and in terms of the outlook there’s a little bit of a bimodal view. So some of my sentences will have multiple conjunctions in them."
439,20130501,FOMC2,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be referring to the materials that have just been handed out, labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”","Okay. With the addition of that sentence, this vote is on alternative B and the associated directive."
440,20130619,FOMC1,"Okay. Why don’t we recommence, and we will start with the economic go-round. We will begin with President Rosengren.","Well, in a recent draft, I pointed out that in this modal scenario, by the middle of 2014, unemployment would be probably close to 7 percent. And what I thought I would do is not say that in the opening statement but reserve it for an answer if I’m asked the question, How do you know that you have achieved substantial improvement? I could"
441,20130619,FOMC2,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be referring to the exhibits that were distributed, “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”",But including the blue and the red. And it will also be on the directive on page 12 of 13 in the package as well
442,20130731,FOMC2,I will be referring to the handouts being distributed. The alternatives are the same as those we provided in the Tealbook except for a small correction in paragraph A(1) that we’ve shown in blue.,"This vote is on alternative B and the associated directive, with changes from what’s shown in the handout as follows. The final sentence of paragraph B(2), on inflation,"
443,20130731,FOMC1,Okay. Everybody is punctually back around the table. We’ll start with President Lacker.,"Thank you very much. Let me try to summarize. The national economy is giving mixed signals. Some see a step-up in economic activity in the second half, with increasing momentum thereafter, and growth in private final demand has been resilient. However, some saw economic growth proceeding at roughly its recent 2 percent pace, assuming no pickup in productivity growth. Others note that the possible growth pickup may be"
444,20130918,FOMC1,"Thank you. Seeing no other contributions to this round, we can start the economic go-round with President Lacker.","Okay. We are going to have Steve Meyer give the introduction in a moment. But before we do that, let me just take a few moments to try to set up what I’m sure will be a very interesting discussion tomorrow. As a lot of people have already anticipated, we have two plausible policy options that we"
445,20130918,FOMC2,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”","Yes. This vote is on the alternative B statement that was handed out, in which the bracketed words in paragraphs 1, 2, and 4 are included and the bracketed sentence in paragraph 5 has been dropped, and the accompanying directive"
446,20131030,FOMC2,"Okay. Why don’t we reconvene? Our last item is current monetary policy, and let me ask Bill English please introduce it.","Yes. This vote is on the alternative B, as the Chairman just described, and the associated directive."
447,20131030,FOMC1,"Any other questions for our colleagues? [No response] If not, then we can begin our economic go-round, and I have Charlie Plosser at the top of my list. President Plosser.","Yes, you can’t just announce a path. In theory, you’d have to announce some kind of reaction function. Anything else? Why don’t we take 20 minutes for coffee and then we’ll do the monetary policy go-round?"
448,20131218,FOMC2,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”","Paragraph 3, as written in black and underlined in red; paragraph 4, as written in black, with underlined red and underlined blue; and paragraph 5, as written in black and underlined red."
449,20131218,FOMC1,"Thank you. Just for accuracy, was that your go-round comment as well, or was that just your financial stability comment? [Laughter] I have you here","Thank you. I’m sorry, I should have allowed any other questions or comments. [No response] Okay. Bill."
450,20140129,FOMC2,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be referring to the exhibits titled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”",This vote will be on the language that Chairman Bernanke just indicated and on the directive as found on page 12 of Bill English’s handout.
451,20140129,FOMC1,"Okay. Let’s recommence, please. We’re ready for the economic go-round, and our first contributor is President Evans.","Good morning, everybody. Thank you very much, again, for last night. Anna and I really appreciated the sendoff and warm wishes. Again, thank you all. I thought I would start with a quick summary of yesterday’s discussion and add a few comments, and then we can turn to the policy go-round. Incoming data have generally been positive, showing strong second-half economic growth. Many saw growth as likely to continue"
452,20140319,FOMC1,"Okay. Seeing no more questions, why don’t we begin our economic go-round? President Williams.","Thank you, Governor Powell. And thanks, everybody, for your observations and comments. It’s been a very interesting discussion. I want to say that, in terms of FOMC management, I am committed to continuity. That said, I now intend to depart slightly from previous practice because we’ve reached the point at which Ben would present an encyclopedic summary of our economic go-round. [Laughter] I sat here and marveled at his ability to accomplish that type of summing up, drawing in insights from every single participant during the go-round."
453,20140319,FOMC2,"Thank you, Madam Chair. I’ll be referring to the exhibits that were distributed before this session that are labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”","Yes. This vote will cover the statement as written on pages 6 and 7 of the monetary policy briefing package, with the changes to the sentences read by Chair Yellen. And it will encompass the directive on page 12 of the monetary policy briefing package."
454,20140430,FOMC2,"As the Chair mentioned, we made some small changes to the alternatives, which are shown in blue in the handout in front of you labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”","As the Chair indicated, the vote will cover alternative B, as described on pages 6 and 7 of Bill’s handout, and the directive on page 12 of Bill’s handout."
455,20140430,FOMC1,"Okay. We have about 25 minutes before we have to break for dinner. So I suggest we begin our economic go-round. We may not be able to get too far, but I think we’ll have plenty of time tomorrow. You may recall that, in the old days, we actually used to have one-day meetings and do everything in a day, so I think we’ll have plenty of time tomorrow to finish. Why don’t we begin the economic go-round and start with President Williams?","Thank you. Well, thank you, everyone, for your comments and observations. At our last meeting, I tried to summarize some of your comments in terms of how they answer a few key questions that bear on our policy decisions, and I thought that, with your indulgence, I would try to do the same thing again today."
456,20140618,FOMC1,"Okay. We will probably continue to discuss this, I think it’s fair to say. Why don’t we begin our go-round? We’re probably going to break around 6:00 for dinner, so if we could get through a reasonable amount of this, it would be good. President Rosengren.","Thank you. Governor Brainard? [No audible response] Okay. Well, I want to thank you for a very interesting set of observations on the economic outlook. At our previous meetings I summarized some of your comments during the go-round by relating them to a few key questions that underpin our policy decisions, and with your indulgence I will"

I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives” that was distributed this morning.",The vote will cover alternative B as described on pages 6 and 7 of Bill English’s handout and directive B on page 12 of the handout.
458,20140730,FOMC1,"Okay. Why don’t we begin our economic round and go, I guess, until six and then go to dinner. And maybe we’ll finish or, alternatively, I think we’ll have a chance to finish tomorrow morning if not now. So let’s start off with President Lacker.","Thank you very much, and thanks to everyone for a very interesting set of observations on the economic outlook. I’ll try once again to summarize some main themes in your comments that relate to the key questions that underpin our policy decisions."
459,20140730,FOMC2,"Thank you, Madam Chair. I’ll be referring to the exhibits labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives” that were distributed earlier.","The vote will cover the FOMC statement, alternative B, on pages 6 and 7 of Bill English’s exhibits, and it will cover the directive on page 12 of that same document."

463,20141029,FOMC1,"Any further comments on financial stability? Okay. Seeing none, why don’t we go into our economic round, and we’ll start with President Rosengren.","Well, we’re two minutes early, but everybody is here. Let’s get going. What I’d like to do is start with a summary of yesterday’s discussion and a few comments, and then we’ll turn to policy."
464,20141217,FOMC2,"Are there any further questions for David? [No response] If not, then let me just start off this morning. First of all, I want to thank you for the comments and suggestions you’ve provided on our draft policy statements in the run-up to this meeting. As has been evident from our ongoing interactions, we have a range of views on how our forward guidance should be cast, and I appreciate everyone’s willingness to work together to find some common ground and to communicate our policy intentions to the public as clearly as possible.","This vote, as Chair Yellen indicated, will be on alternative B, depicted on pages 6 and 7 of Bill English’s handout. It will not have the word “somewhat” on line 3. It will also cover the directive on page 11."
465,20141217,FOMC1,I think we’re ready now to begin our economic go-round. President Lacker is going to start us off.,"Thank you very much. Let me thank everyone for a very thoughtful round of observations on the economic outlook. I think this has been an unusually rich discussion. I’m not going to be able to do it justice. I have a couple of comments of my own, but before I share those, I’ll try as I usually do to summarize the main themes in your economic remarks, taking note particularly of how they bear on your assessment of progress we have seen toward closing the employment and inflation gaps and the question of whether incoming"
466,20150128,FOMC1,"Any further comment? All right. After looking very carefully, I see none. So what I’m going to suggest is that we begin our economic go-round and maybe go for 20 or 25 minutes, and then have a coffee break. And to start us off, President Fisher.","Thank you. Well, let me thank everyone for another very thoughtful round of observations on the outlook. I will, as usual, try to summarize a few of the main themes in your remarks, especially as they relate to actual progress we have made in achieving our dual"

This vote will be on alternative B, which is on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas’s handout, with the changes indicated by the Chair: the addition in paragraph 3, and without the language in brackets in paragraph 2. It would also be on the directive for alternative B, as depicted on page 11 of Thomas’s briefing."
468,20150318,FOMC1,"Okay. Why don’t we begin our round, and start with President Williams.","Thank you very much, and my thanks to everyone for another interesting round of observations on the economic outlook.

469,20150318,FOMC2,Thank you. Are there any comments? [No response] Okay. Then I’d like to ask for a show of hands among all participants. I’m going to take a straw poll here to find out who supports this language being added to our normalization principles. Can you raise your hand if you’re supportive? [Show of hands] Okay. And is there anyone who is not?,"Very well. The vote will be on alternative B, as depicted on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas’s handout, and on the directive on page 11 of that same handout."
470,20150429,FOMC1,"Great. Does anyone else want to comment? [No response] Seeing no hands, let us begin the economic go-round with President Mester.","Well, thank you.

473,20150617,FOMC2,"Thank you, Madam Chair. I didn’t quite muster the courage to break decisively with dress code in this room, but in appreciation of President Williams’s gift that I have here with me, I managed to slip seven mentions of “data dependence” or “data dependent” into my text.","Okay. Why don’t we leave the directive unchanged for today. And that means that what I’d like to do is have Matt take the roll call for a vote on alternative B as written, and the directive, which is the top version on page 14 of Thomas’s handout."
474,20150729,FOMC2,"Good morning, everybody. This morning we’re going to start off with Thomas’s briefing about monetary policy alternatives.","Yes.

485,20160316,FOMC2,"Thank you, Madam Chair. I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for the Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”","Thank you, Madam Chair. This vote will be on the policy statement for alternative B on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas’s briefing materials, and it will also be on the directive to the Desk that is included on page 10 of those materials."
486,20160427,FOMC2,"Thank you, Madam Chair. I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for the Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”","Thank you, Madam Chair. As you mentioned, this vote will be on the policy statement for alternative B as indicated on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas’s briefing materials and on the directive to the Desk as included in the implementation note on page 10 of those materials."
487,20160427,FOMC1,"Okay, folks, let’s resume. I think we can now begin our economic go-round. And our first speaker is President Williams.","Okay, let me start off. As many of you have noted, the news from the labor market continues to be good. Monthly payroll gains averaged almost 210,000 over the past three months, just a little slower than the robust pace last year. And labor force participation was up again in March, continuing the recent trend that’s allowed the unemployment rate to remain roughly flat since October even as the employment-to-population ratio has risen markedly. The pool of potential workers—the unemployed plus those who would like a job but are not actively looking for work—has continued to shrink."
488,20160615,FOMC1,"Okay, folks. Let us resume. I think we can begin our economic go-round. I’d like to call on President Bullard first.","Well, my thanks to everyone for an interesting discussion of the economic outlook and risks. I’d like to add a few brief comments of my own. Prior to June 3, I would have said that things were going well. Labor market indicators, on the whole, were favorable and suggested continued improvement into the spring. The incoming data showed a sizable pickup in consumer spending after the winter’s weakness, as expected, and the housing sector continued its gradual recovery."
489,20160615,FOMC2,"I will do my best. Thank you, Madam Chair. I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.” In financial markets, one notable development in recent years has been the sizable decline in longer-term Treasury yields. That decline continued over the intermeeting period, leaving the 10-year yield close to historic lows.","Thank you, Madam Chair. As you said, this vote will be on the policy statement for alternative B shown on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas’s briefing package and also on the directive to the Desk as included in the implementation note shown on page 10 of that package."
490,20160727,FOMC1,"Thank you. Is there anybody else who would like to comment on financial stability issues? You’re welcome to weigh in. [No response] Okay.

I’d just like to add a couple of brief comments of my own."
491,20160727,FOMC2,"Thank you, Madam Chair. I’ll be referring to the handout labeled “Material for the Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.” As noted in your earlier briefings, U.S. financial conditions appear to have become, on balance, more accommodative during the intermeeting period.","Thank you, Madam Chair.
