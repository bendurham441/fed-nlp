# To do

- deal with unicode characters in speeches, perhaps in a generalized function that can be applied in multiple places
- ODE filtering, filter out utterances likely to be procedural, like in Shapiro and Wilson
- Find a way to only include governors, and voting members [see this link](https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2022/nov/fomc-voting-rotation-explained)
- consider dropping tfidf below some threshold
- use other sentiment dictionaries
- set this up on other computer
- store csvs safely and centrally
- transcripts pre 1999
- speeches pre-2006
- remove "References" section from speeches
- remove numbers, remaining punctuation
- remove NaNs
- make readme
    - instructions to reproduce
    - file descriptions
    - required packages and how to set up conda
    - acknowledgements
- document each of the jupyter notebooks
- get rid of votes from transcripts
